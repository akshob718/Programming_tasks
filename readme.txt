Challenge 1: Please refer the document.

Challenge 2:  Arithmetic-Geometric mean of two numbers
The program takes the lower limit and upper limit of the range, generates pairs and calculates the AGM for each pair and plots a graph for pairs on x-axis and AGM values on y-axis.

Challenge 3: Chaos game and Sierpinski triangle
Given N, a Sierpinski triangle is generated and a plot is shown every 100 iterations as an intermediate result, and a final plot after 500 points.
If we try this procedure with a square, we simply get a square filled with random dots.
However it is possible to get small squres inside a large square with slight modifications.
1. Pick a side of the squre at random
2. Move 1/3 way to the chosen side.


Challenge 4: Collatz Conjecture
The program takes the lower limit and upper limit of the range, and calculates the number of iterations needed for each number in the range. The program has 2 plots, line-graph followed by the histogram

Challenge 5: Gray code
The program takes the list of n_values and computes the gray code for each value of n in the list. The plot shows the number of steps needed to reach the fixed point for different values of n
